# Cycle-GAN-
Cycle GAN for synthetic data generation 
The Cycle Generative Adversarial Network, or CycleGAN, is an approach to training a deep convolutional neural network for image-to-image translation tasks. The Network learns mapping between input and output images using unpaired dataset.

In this we will be using cycle GAN for generating synthetic data to boost up the accuracy of scene classifier
